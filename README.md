# BishopAndRook
A genetic algorithm written in Python language to solve the problem of placing two bishops and two rooks on a (4x4) chessboard without having conflicts.

Note: the final result is a matrix (4x2) which represnts the locations (i,j) on the board where first two columns represent the bishops and last two columns reprent the rooks.
